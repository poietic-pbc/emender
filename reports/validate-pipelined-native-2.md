# Pipelined native DiLoCo two-node gate attempt

Date: 2026-07-20  
Task: `validate-pipelined-native-2`  
Result: **blocked before submission by the fail-closed allocation-overlap guard**

Retry note (agent-1346): the retry on the same date re-read both normative
design authorities, verified that the authoritative checkout still resolved
`HEAD`, `main`, and `origin/main` to `176ae0bc11db5bf1cad51008d6891d209867004c`,
and performed a fresh scheduler preflight.  Job `5035539` was still RUNNING on
32 nodes (`validate-native-pool-32n-late-ready-fixed`), so the no-overlap
condition had not changed and no `sbatch` call was permissible.
The exact canonical activation and approved clean-gate command were invoked
again; the launcher exited 69 with `refusing to overlap another user
allocation`, proving that the retry also stopped before `sbatch`.

## Concrete attempt

The canonical Frontier environment was activated with:

```text
source scripts/frontier/activate_emender_frontier.sh
```

The submission source was the authoritative checkout
`/lustre/orion/bif148/scratch/erikgarrison/emender` on branch `main`.
At the attempt, `HEAD`, `main`, and `origin/main` all resolved to:

```text
176ae0bc11db5bf1cad51008d6891d209867004c
```

The exact source native bundle was rebuilt before submission:

```text
PYTHON_BIN="$EMENDER_PYTHON" BUILD_JOBS=8 \
  bash scripts/frontier/build_native_resilient_dataplane.sh
```

All 10 native CTests passed. The retained build manifest was:

```text
/lustre/orion/bif148/scratch/erikgarrison/emender/build/native-resilient-dataplane/native-artifacts.json
sha256 cad13e0ebb93761f2bd9e8217ded24cb1592d9f9e59367a93dda6ca9c0a51fda
```

At `2026-07-20T12:41:36Z`, the exact approved submission command was
invoked from that authoritative `main` checkout:

```text
NDP_BUILD_MANIFEST=/lustre/orion/bif148/scratch/erikgarrison/emender/build/native-resilient-dataplane/native-artifacts.json \
NDP_PYTHON_BIN="$EMENDER_PYTHON" \
bash scripts/frontier/submit_native_dataplane_2n_gate.sh clean
```

It exited 69 with the expected fail-closed diagnostic:

```text
refusing to overlap another user allocation
```

The conflicting allocation observed immediately after the attempt was:

```text
5035539|validate-native-pool-32n-late-ready-fixed|RUNNING|32|3:24|30:00
```

No `sbatch` invocation was reached and no job of any size was submitted by
this task. In particular, no 4-node-or-larger job was submitted.

## Acceptance status

Because the approved launcher refused submission, no live two-node artifact
was created and none of the runtime-only claims are made. Five atomic K40
generations, overlap/cadence timing, foreground-idle percentage, bounded
latest-only behavior under loss/rejoin, rejection evidence, and atomic
checkpoint restart remain unverified by this attempt.

There is also an acceptance mismatch that must be resolved before a retry:
`submit_native_dataplane_2n_gate.sh clean` fixes `NDP_GENERATIONS=3` and its
batch payload requires one warm-up plus three timed synthetic native data-plane
generations. The present task requires at least five atomic **K40 trainer**
generations plus checkpoint/failure behavior. The real K40 split-role path is
`scripts/frontier/resilient_e97_true_2n.sbatch`; a retry must use a reviewed,
fail-closed two-node submit artifact for that path rather than treating three
synthetic data-plane generations as the requested live training proof.

The merged real-model batch artifact has a second hard mismatch.  Its
supervisor bounds each K40 stage at 420 seconds, while the batch script admits
only 20- or 30-minute non-startup gates.  Five worst-case K40 windows alone are
35 minutes, before foreground handoff/apply, integrity, redistribution, and
checkpoint publication.  Submitting that payload with five generations would
therefore not be a fail-closed way to establish the requested acceptance
artifact.  A reviewed launcher must provide a bounded walltime sufficient for
five K40 generations and must explicitly orchestrate and validate all requested
fault/restart phases; those controls are not present in the named submitter.

## Architecture conformance

Authority checked: *Resilient DiLoCo Compute Pool*, version 1 (2026-07-17),
and *Native resilient DiLoCo data plane v1*. Applicable gap-matrix requirement
IDs are R01-R16 and NDP01-NDP17.

The attempted command conformed to the admission safety portion of R01/R14 and
NDP17: authoritative identity was pinned, the current native bundle was built
and tested under the canonical environment, the launcher was exactly two-node
and CXI-only, and its overlap guard failed closed before scheduler mutation.
The remaining conformance checklist items require a live allocation and are not
claimed here.
